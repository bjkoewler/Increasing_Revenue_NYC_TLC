    "# Activity: Perform logistic regression \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will complete an effective bionomial logistic regression. This exercise will help you better understand the value of using logistic regression to make predictions for a dependent variable based on one independent variable and help you build confidence in practicing logistic regression. Because logistic regression is leveraged across a wide array of industries, becoming proficient in this process will help you expand your skill set in a widely-applicable way.   \n",
    "\n",
    "For this activity, you work as a consultant for an airline. The airline is interested in knowing if a better in-flight entertainment experience leads to higher customer satisfaction. They would like you to construct and evaluate a model that predicts whether a future customer would be satisfied with their services given previous customer feedback about their flight experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this activity is for a sample size of 129,880 customers. It includes data points such as class, flight distance, and in-flight entertainment, among others. Your goal will be to utilize a binomial logistic regression model to help the airline model and better understand this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because this activity uses a dataset from the industry, you will need to conduct basic EDA, data cleaning, and other manipulations to prepare the data for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will practice the following skills:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Importing packages and loading data\n",
    "* Exploring the data and completing the cleaning process\n",
    "* Building a binomial logistic regression model \n",
    "* Evaluating a binomial logistic regression model using a confusion matrix"

    "## Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are some key takeaways that you learned from this lab?**\n",
    "* Logistic Regression models classify categorical data based on previous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creating a Logistic Regression model involves several steps. Importing all relevant libraries, modules and packages, subsetting the data, isolating the X and y variables, splitting data into train and test segments, building and fitting the model, generating predictions of the y variable, calculating metrics and creating a confusion matrix to evaluate the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What findings would you share with others?**\n",
    "* The data consisted of $129,880$ observations\n",
    "* $54.73$% of customers from the origninal dataframe were satisfied\n",
    "* 393 rows were removed to account for the missing data in arrival delay time\n",
    "* The dependent variable is satisfaction, and the independent variable is inflight entertainment.\n",
    "* The technique required was a binomial logisitic regression model.\n",
    "* The model was trained on 70% of the dataset, and tested on 30%.\n",
    "* The model's metrics are as follows:\n",
    "    * Accuracy: $0.801529$\n",
    "    * Precision: $0.816142$\n",
    "    * Recall: $0.821530$\n",
    "    * F1 Score: $0.818827$\n",
    "* The model labeled:\n",
    "    * $17000$ true positives\n",
    "    * $14000$ true negatives\n",
    "    * $4000$ false positives\n",
    "    * $3700$ false negatives\n",
    "\n",
    "**What would you recommend to stakeholders?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy, precision and recall of this model are modest. The model could benefit from adding independent variables to more closely capture what drives satisfaction. However, we have established that as inflight entertainment values increse, so does customer satisfaction. This indicates that it inflight entertainment options are important for customers, and it may be benefical to find more detail about what they prefer to further enhance the contribution that inflight entertainment has on satisfaction."
