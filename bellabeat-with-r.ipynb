The median user spends 433 minutes asleep. The median and mean were similar for the minutes asleep and lightly active minutes variables. Larger differences were seen for total steps, total distance, calories, sedentary, fairly active and very active minutes variables. These differences were skewed upward significantly likely due to outliers, hence why the median was used instead of mean.\n\nThere is a positive correlation between total steps and total distance, and between time in bed and time asleep.\n\nThere is a negative correlation between sedentary minutes and lightly active minutes, and between total minutes asleep and total steps.\n\nA mostly negative correlation is seen between sedentary minutes and total steps up to about 11,000 steps where the relationship then becomes positive. An explanation may be that sedentary minutes decreases due to time spent walking up to a point where the walking begins to significantly fatigue the person, eliminating other forms of exercise and movement and increasing sedentary minutes.  \n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Share Phase","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Plots were created for presentation to stakeholders, illustrating the most interesting or surprising trends found.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ggplot(combined_data1, aes(x = lightly_active_minutes, y = sedentary_minutes)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_smooth()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ggplot(combined_data1, aes(x = very_active_minutes, y = sedentary_minutes)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_smooth()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ggplot(combined_data1, aes(x = total_steps, y = total_minutes_asleep)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_smooth()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Correlation coefficients calculated for each plot to more accurately interpret the relationships.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cor(combined_data1$total_steps, combined_data1$total_distance)\ncor(combined_data1$total_minutes_asleep, combined_data1$total_steps)\ncor(combined_data1$sedentary_minutes, combined_data1$very_active_minutes)\ncor(combined_data1$sedentary_minutes, combined_data1$lightly_active_minutes)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Google slide presentation created to present visualizations, data, conclusions and recommendations.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Coding addendum\nAfter having the case study reviewed by a data professional, it was suggessted to use the ggpairs() function from GGally, an extension to GGplot2, to create a correllelogram to visualize all correlations of relevant variables.
