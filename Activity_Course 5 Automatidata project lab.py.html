# # **Automatidata project**
# **Course 5 - Regression Analysis: Simplify complex data relationships**

# The data consulting firm Automatidata has recently hired you as the newest member of their data analytics team. Their newest client, the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), wants the Automatidata team to build a multiple linear regression model to predict taxi fares using existing data that was collected over the course of a year. The team is getting closer to completing the project, having completed an initial plan of action, initial Python coding work, EDA, and A/B testing.
# 
# The Automatidata team has reviewed the results of the A/B testing. Now it’s time to work on predicting the taxi fare amounts. You’ve impressed your Automatidata colleagues with your hard work and attention to detail. The data team believes that you are ready to build the regression model and update the client New York City TLC about your progress.
# 
# A notebook was structured and prepared to help you in this project. Please complete the following questions.

# # Course 5 End-of-course project: Build a multiple linear regression model
# 
# In this activity, you will build a multiple linear regression model. As you've learned, multiple linear regression helps you estimate the linear relationship between one continuous dependent variable and two or more independent variables. For data science professionals, this is a useful skill because it allows you to consider more than one variable against the variable you're measuring against. This opens the door for much more thorough and flexible analysis to be completed. 
# 
# Completing this activity will help you practice planning out and buidling a multiple linear regression model based on a specific business need. The structure of this activity is designed to emulate the proposals you will likely be assigned in your career as a data professional. Completing this activity will help prepare you for those career moments.

# 
# ## PACE: **Analyze**
# 
# In this stage, consider the following question where applicable to complete your code response:
# 
# * What are some purposes of EDA before constructing a multiple linear regression model?
# 

# Cleaning and organizing the data, removing missing data, identifying independent and dependent variables, verifying assumptions, prepare the data for modeling.

# ### Task 2a. Explore data with EDA
# 
# Analyze and discover data, looking for correlations, missing data, outliers, and duplicates.

# Start with `.shape` and `.info()`.

# In[3]:


# Start with `.shape` and `.info()`
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
df0.shape

# ### Task 2b. Convert pickup & dropoff columns to datetime
# 

# In[6]:


# Check the format of the data
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
df0['tpep_pickup_datetime'].head()


# In[7]:


# Convert datetime columns to datetime
### YOUR CODE HERE ###

df0.info()


# In[8]:


df0['tpep_pickup_datetime'].dtype


# ### Task 2c. Create duration column

# Create a new column called `duration` that represents the total number of minutes that each taxi ride took.

# In[9]:


#Create a `duration` column
df0['duration'] = (df0['tpep_dropoff_datetime'] - df0['tpep_pickup_datetime'])/np.timedelta64(1, 'm')
df0.head()


# In[10]:


df0['tpep_pickup_datetime'].dtype


# ### Outliers
# 
# Call `df.info()` to inspect the columns and decide which ones to check for outliers.

# In[11]:


### YOUR CODE HERE ###
df0.info()


# Keeping in mind that many of the features will not be used to fit your model, the most important columns to check for outliers are likely to be:
# * `trip_distance`
# * `fare_amount`
# * `duration`
# 
# 

# ### Task 2d. Box plots
# 
# Plot a box plot for each feature: `trip_distance`, `fare_amount`, `duration`.

# In[12]:


### YOUR CODE HERE ###
fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize = (12, 12))

sns.boxplot(df0['fare_amount'], ax = axes[0])
axes[0].set_title('Distribution of Fare Amount')
axes[0].set_xlabel('USD')

sns.boxplot(df0['trip_distance'], ax = axes[1])
axes[1].set_title('Distribution of Trip Distance')
axes[1].set_xlabel('Miles')

sns.boxplot(df0['duration'], ax = axes[2])
axes[2].set_title('Distribution of Trip Duration')
axes[2].set_xlabel('Minutes')

plt.tight_layout()


# **Questions:** 
# 1. Which variable(s) contains outliers? 
# 
# 2. Are the values in the `trip_distance` column unbelievable?
# 
# 3. What about the lower end? Do distances, fares, and durations of 0 (or negative values) make sense?

# 1. All variables have outliers. The variables `duration_minutes` and `fare_amount` have extreme outliers. 
# 2. For the most part, values in `trip_distance` appear believable. However, there do appear to be several trips at 0.
# 3. There are negative values in `duration_minutes` and `fare_amount`, which are errorneous and need to be removed.

# In[13]:


df0.info()


# ### Task 2e. Imputations

# #### `trip_distance` outliers
# 
# You know from the summary statistics that there are trip distances of 0. Are these reflective of erroneous data, or are they very short trips that get rounded down?
# 
# To check, sort the column values, eliminate duplicates, and inspect the least 10 values. Are they rounded values or precise values?

# In[14]:


# Are trip distances of 0 bad data or very short trips rounded down?
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
sorted(set(df0['trip_distance']))


# The distances are captured with a high degree of precision. However, it might be possible for trips to have distances of zero if a passenger summoned a taxi and then changed their mind. Besides, are there enough zero values in the data to pose a problem?
# 
# Calculate the count of rides where the `trip_distance` is zero.

# In[15]:


### YOUR CODE HERE ###
(df0['trip_distance'] == 0).sum()


# #### `fare_amount` outliers

# In[16]:


### YOUR CODE HERE ###
df0['fare_amount'].describe()


# **Question:** What do you notice about the values in the `fare_amount` column?
# * There is a minimum value of -120 and a maximum value of 999.99. It seems unlikley that there was fare that enormous and negative fares simply don't make sense.
# 

# In[17]:


# Impute values less than $0 with 0
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
df0.loc[df0['fare_amount'] < 0, 'fare_amount'] = 0
sum((df0['fare_amount'] < 0))


# Now impute the maximum value as `Q3 + (6 * IQR)`.

# #### `duration` outliers
# 

# In[20]:


# Call .describe() for duration outliers
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
df0['duration'].describe()


# The `duration` column has problematic values at both the lower and upper extremities.
# 
# * **Low values:** There should be no values that represent negative time. Impute all negative durations with `0`.
# 
# * **High values:** Impute high values the same way you imputed the high-end outliers for fares: `Q3 + (6 * IQR)`.

# In[21]:


# Impute a 0 for any negative values
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
df0.loc[df0['duration'] < 0, 'duration'] = 0


# In[22]:


# Impute the high outliers
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
outlierimputer(['duration'], 6)


# ### Task 3a. Feature engineering

# #### Create `mean_distance` column
# 
# When deployed, the model will not know the duration of a trip until after the trip occurs, so you cannot train a model that uses this feature. However, you can use the statistics of trips you *do* know to generalize about ones you do not know.
# 
# In this step, create a column called `mean_distance` that captures the mean distance for each group of trips that share pickup and dropoff points.
# 
# For example, if your data were:
# 
# |Trip|Start|End|Distance|
# |--: |:---:|:-:|    |
# | 1  | A   | B | 1  |
# | 2  | C   | D | 2  |
# | 3  | A   | B |1.5 |
# | 4  | D   | C | 3  |
# 
# The results should be:
# ```
# A -> B: 1.25 miles
# C -> D: 2 miles
# D -> C: 3 miles
# ```
# 
# Notice that C -> D is not the same as D -> C. All trips that share a unique pair of start and end points get grouped and averaged.
# 
# Then, a new column `mean_distance` will be added where the value at each row is the average for all trips with those pickup and dropoff locations:
# 
# |Trip|Start|End|Distance|mean_distance|
# |--: |:---:|:-:|  :--   |:--   |
# | 1  | A   | B | 1      | 1.25 |
# | 2  | C   | D | 2      | 2    |
# | 3  | A   | B |1.5     | 1.25 |
# | 4  | D   | C | 3      | 3    |
# 
# 
# Begin by creating a helper column called `pickup_dropoff`, which contains the unique combination of pickup and dropoff location IDs for each row.
# 
# One way to do this is to convert the pickup and dropoff location IDs to strings and join them, separated by a space. The space is to ensure that, for example, a trip with pickup/dropoff points of 12 & 151 gets encoded differently than a trip with points 121 & 51.
# 
# So, the new column would look like this:
# 
# |Trip|Start|End|pickup_dropoff|
# |--: |:---:|:-:|  :--         |
# | 1  | A   | B | 'A B'        |
# | 2  | C   | D | 'C D'        |
# | 3  | A   | B | 'A B'        |
# | 4  | D   | C | 'D C'        |
# 

# In[23]:


# Create `pickup_dropoff` column
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
df0['pickup_dropoff'] = df0['PULocationID'].astype(str) + ' ' + df0['DOLocationID'].astype(str)


# Now, use a `groupby()` statement to group each row by the new `pickup_dropoff` column, compute the mean, and capture the values only in the `trip_distance` column. Assign the results to a variable named `grouped`.

# In[24]:


### YOUR CODE HERE ###
grouped = df0.groupby('pickup_dropoff').mean()[['trip_distance']]
grouped[:5]


# `grouped` is an object of the `DataFrame` class.
# 
# 1. Convert it to a dictionary using the [`to_dict()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_dict.html) method. Assign the results to a variable called `grouped_dict`. This will result in a dictionary with a key of `trip_distance` whose values are another dictionary. The inner dictionary's keys are pickup/dropoff points and its values are mean distances. This is the information you want.
# 
# ```
# Example:
# grouped_dict = {'trip_distance': {'A B': 1.25, 'C D': 2, 'D C': 3}
# ```
# 
# 2. Reassign the `grouped_dict` dictionary so it contains only the inner dictionary. In other words, get rid of `trip_distance` as a key, so:
# 
# ```
# Example:
# grouped_dict = {'A B': 1.25, 'C D': 2, 'D C': 3}
#  ```

# In[25]:


# 1. Convert `grouped` to a dictionary
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
grouped_dict = grouped.to_dict()

# 2. Reassign to only contain the inner dictionary
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
grouped_dict = grouped_dict['trip_distance']
grouped_dict


# 1. Create a `mean_distance` column that is a copy of the `pickup_dropoff` helper column.
# 
# 2. Use the [`map()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.map.html#pandas-series-map) method on the `mean_distance` series. Pass `grouped_dict` as its argument. Reassign the result back to the `mean_distance` series.
# </br></br>
# When you pass a dictionary to the `Series.map()` method, it will replace the data in the series where that data matches the dictionary's keys. The values that get imputed are the values of the dictionary.
# 
# ```
# Example:
# df['mean_distance']
# ```
# 
# |mean_distance |
# |  :-:         |
# | 'A B'        |
# | 'C D'        |
# | 'A B'        |
# | 'D C'        |
# | 'E F'        |
# 
# ```
# grouped_dict = {'A B': 1.25, 'C D': 2, 'D C': 3}
# df['mean_distance`] = df['mean_distance'].map(grouped_dict)
# df['mean_distance']
# ```
# 
# |mean_distance |
# |  :-:         |
# | 1.25         |
# | 2            |
# | 1.25         |
# | 3            |
# | NaN          |
# 
# When used this way, the `map()` `Series` method is very similar to `replace()`, however, note that `map()` will impute `NaN` for any values in the series that do not have a corresponding key in the mapping dictionary, so be careful.

# ## PACE: **Execute**
# 
# Consider the questions in your PACE Strategy Document to reflect on the Execute stage.

# ### Task 9a. Results
# 
# Use the code cell below to get `actual`,`predicted`, and `residual` for the testing set, and store them as columns in a `results` dataframe.

# In[49]:


# Create a `results` dataframe
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
results = pd.DataFrame({'actual': y_test['fare_amount'], 
                        'predicted' : y_pred_test.ravel()})
results['residual'] = results['actual'] - results['predicted']
results


# ### Task 9b. Visualize model results

# Create a scatterplot to visualize `actual` vs. `predicted`.

# In[74]:


# Create a scatterplot to visualize `predicted` over `actual`
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
sns.set(style = 'whitegrid')
sns.regplot(x = results['actual'], y = results['predicted'], 
            scatter_kws = {'alpha' : 0.3, 's' : 15},
            line_kws = {'color' : 'red' })
plt.ylim([0, 70])
plt.xlim([0, 70])
plt.title('Relationship of Actual values and Predicted values for Test data')
plt.xlabel('Actual y values')
plt.ylabel('Predicted y values')


# Visualize the distribution of the `residuals` using a histogram.

plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()


# In[52]:


# Calculate residual mean
### YOUR CODE HERE ###
residual_mean = results['residual'].mean()

# Create a scatterplot of `residuals` over `predicted`.

# Create a scatterplot of `residuals` over `predicted`

plt.axhline(c = 'red')
plt.title('Relationship of Residual values and Predicted values')
plt.xlabel('Predicted y values')
plt.ylabel('Residual values')
plt.show()


# ### Task 9c. Coefficients
# 
# Use the `coef_` attribute to get the model's coefficients. The coefficients are output in the order of the features that were used to train the model. Which feature had the greatest effect on trip fare?

# In[54]:


# Output the model's coefficients
coefficients = pd.DataFrame(data = model.coef_, columns = X.columns)
coefficients


# What do these coefficients mean? How should they be interpreted?

# These coefficients indicate the correlation of the independent variable with the dependent variable. When a coefficient is positive, this indicates that as the value of the independent variable increases, so does the mean of the dependent variable. If the coefficient is negative, then as the value of the independent variable increases, the mean of the dependent variable tends to decrease. The size of the coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship.
# In this case, the third variable in the table, `mean_distance`, has the strongest correlation with `fare_amount`, followed by `mean_duration`, `rush_hour`, `passenger_count`, and `vendorID_2`.

# #REVISED
# While the above explanation is correct, it is not fully correct. The numbers above are represented in dollars of fare_amount and quantify the strength of the feature on the target variable. It must be noted that because the StandardScaler() function was used, the unit of `mean_distance` is no longer miles. So when intepreting this value, the correct interpretation is: controlling for other variables, when `mean_distance` increases by 1 standard deviation, `fare_amount` increases by $7.13. To return to miles, the data must be descaled.

# In[55]:


print(X_train['mean_distance'].std())
print(7.13 / X_train['mean_distance'].std())


# Now that the data has been descaled, we can intepret a more useful meaning: For every 2 miles, `fare_amount` increases by $7.13.

# ### Task 9d. Conclusion
# 
# 1. What are the key takeaways from this notebook?
# 
# 
# 
# 2. What results can be presented from this notebook?
# 
# 

# 1 
# * Preparation of the data is key - exploring, cleaning, sorting and organizing into a structure that is useful and appropriate for further analysis and model construction. 
# * Outliers were addressed by calculating upper threshold for normal values and imputing that number into outliers.
# * Negative values were removed and replaced by imputing 0.
# * Features were egineered, by creating new variables to enhance analysis.
# * Modeling variables were isolated, then examined for correlation
# * Outcome variables were separated from the target variable, and a multiple linear regression model was trained and tested.
# * Model assumptions were checked and model efficiency was evaluated.
#    
# 2
# * Of the variables from the dataset and from those created for analysis, 'mean_distance' has the highest correlation with 'fare_amount', followed by 'mean_duration'. 
# * When using the 5 variables of `passenger_count`, `mean_duration`, `mean_distance`, `rush_hour`, and `vendorID_2`, the coeffeicient of determination is 0.87 for the testing data, meaning, these variables account for 87 percent of the variation in the target variable, `fare_amount`.
# *  Evaluation metrics for test data
#     * Residual Sum of Squares: 64676.784427
#     * Mean Absolute Error: 2.122509
#     * Mean Squared Error: 14.245988
#     * Root Mean Squared Error: 3.774386
# * To enhance model accuracy, adding other independent variables and removing those that did not have a high correlation may be considered.
